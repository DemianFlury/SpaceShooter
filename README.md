# SpaceShooter

This is my first project in Godot. It's a small arcade game, where you shoot asteroids. I know, very original.
I am folowing this [Youtube-Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iHCXBpxbdsOByZ55Ez4bgF)

## Things I would like to add
- the actual game
- shooting animation
- sounds
- highscore or streak system
- LOOOORE (Pilot has to reach planet for distress signal, survive for x seconds)
- voice lines and dialog box
- spaceship & laser color customisation
- custom keybinds
